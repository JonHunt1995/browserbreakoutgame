## Usage
First, click onto the game screen to keep your cursor focussed onto the game. Then move your cursor from side to side (don't need to click and drag) to control your paddle. The objective is to hit all of the bricks without allowing the ball to get past your paddle, else the game is over and the red screen of death appears. If you manage to hit all of the bricks, you win

For controlling the ball, the closer to the middle of the paddle, the slower and more straight up and down the ball will travel. If the ball hits the edges, then it will go faster and the ball will go in the same direction as that side. Otherwise, the ball should maintain approximately the same speed and bounce in the direction that you expect. Have fun!
